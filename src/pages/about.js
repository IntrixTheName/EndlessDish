      <h6>Endless Dish started the way that some of the best ideas do, in a dorm room with <em>only a little bit</em> of wine.</h6>
      <p>&emsp;I liked cooking, even if I wasn&#39;t the best chef around (and a few years out of practice), but my friends took a chance on me and let me cook for them. EVen a few dishes in, I regained my skill and started branching out to more exotic dishes, making do with the limited equiptment and time that an engineering student had in a dorm kitchen. </p>
      <p>&emsp;Several people wanted me to share the recipes with my community, which I did, sharing fancy formatted files with the recipes and my personal touch. At the time, Endless Dish was a project hosted in a shared OneDrive folder.</p>
      <p>&emsp;Since then, I gained the experience and skills to design a website, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing now. I want this website to stand both for the love I have for my friends, family, and community brought together by the Endless Dish project, and as a toast to myself for following my motto of &quot;Endless Learning&quot; that got me to this point of a portfolio project.</p>
      <p>&emsp;I hope the Endless Dish project can bring you a sense of community as well, you never truly understand how much communal meals can bring people together until they become a fixture in your life.</p>
